The projects in this repository cover various topics, including network interactions, web applications, and extending tools using Python. This repository serves as a practical companion to the book, providing hands-on examples and code.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

    Black-Hat-Python-Projects/
    ├── Chapter01/
    │ ├── script1.py

    ├── Chapter02/
    │ ├── script1.py
    │ └── script2.py
    ├── Chapter03/
    │ ├── script1.py
    │ └── script2.py
    ├── venv/
    ├── .gitignore
